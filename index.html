    <P>This portfolio is about Travelling. 
        Travelling takes us to see taste and try new things. 
        It constantly challenges us not only to adapt to and explore 
        new sorroundings but also to engage with different people, 
        to embrace adventures as they come and to share new and meaningful
         experiences with friends and loved ones.</P>
