    <p>Having been born and bred in the City, i was always fascinated by the beautiful landscape,
         meadows and valleys, rivers and lakes whenever i needed to travel upcountry or out of town.
        As i grew older the more exciting it became and whenever i had a chance to travel my camera 
    was always at hand to capture the beutiful sceneries and capture memories.
As previously mentioned we not only explore new sorroundings when we travel but also engage with different people,
cultural beliefs.
Through my travels i have been able to visit all the 47 counties in Kenya, i have enjoyed the different weather
patterns, diffrent kind of food, different cultures. This exposure has led to a change in mindset and how i perceive
things.
I can't wait to start exploring the world and would love it if you joined me.
Question is: Are you travel ready?
